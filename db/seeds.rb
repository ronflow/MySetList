D/F#                         E7/G#
     Waiting, watching the clock, it`s four o`clock
           D/F#
It`s got stop
                E7/G#
Tell him, take no more she practices her speech
      F6/A              G/B
As he opens the door, she rolls over
    F6/A                  G/B
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over

D               A             G5        D
  She lies and says she`s in love with him
              A         G5
Can`t find a better man
D                A           G5       D
  She dreams in colour she dreams in red

1x D/F#                E7/G#

 Know, She Tells herself, ohh…

[Drums]

D/F#                              E7/G#
     Memories, back when she was bold and strong

And waiting for

The world to come along, swears she knew it now she
   G/B
Swears he`s gone

D               A             G5        D

Can`t find a better man
D                A           G5       D

My jaw left hurting
Oh, dropped wide open

Letra:

 Outshined
(Chris Cornell)

Intro 4x
I got up feeling so down
I got off being sold out
I`ve kept the movie rolling
But the story`s getting old now

Oh yeah

I just looked in the mirror
Things aren`t looking so good
I`m looking California
And feeling Minnesota

Oh yeah

So now you know, 
who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I`d like to say
That I`m down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I`m up on my feet again
I`m feeling outshined
 
SOLO 4x  
 

Someone let the dogs out
They`ll show you where the truth is
The grass is always greener
Where the dogs are shedding

Yeah oh yeah

I`m feeling that I`m sober
Even though I`m drinking
I can`t get any lower
Still I feel I`m sinking

So now you know, who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I`d like to say
That I`m down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I`m up on my feet again
I`m feeling outshined


Guitarra
Bumbo
3x D  D   C  C 

Refrao 
So now you know, who gets mystified

2x
Show me the power child, I`d like to say
That I`m down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I`m up on my feet again

I`m feeling   I`m feeling   outshined

Hunger Strike 



play 4x        

I don`t mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can`t feed on the powerless
When my cup`s already overfilled


But it`s on the table
The fire is cooking
And they`re farming babies
While slaves are working
Blood is on the table
And the mouths are choking
But I`m growing hungry

Like a Stone




      Gm    F
On a cobweb afternoon
     Dm7(11)              Eb
In a         room full of emptiness
        Gm   F
By a freeway I confess
      Dm7(11)              Eb
I was         lost in the pages

Gm         F
Of a book full of death
 Dm7(11)           Eb
Reading how we`ll die alone
    Gm                   F
And if we`re good we`ll lay to rest
Dm7(11)      Eb
Anywhere we want to go

On my deathbed I will pray

To the          gods and the angels
        Gm      F
Like a pagan to anyone
         Dm7(11)             Eb
Who will         take me to Heaven
 Gm        F
To a place I recall
Dm7(11)         Eb
I was there so long ago
      Gm                  F
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled

For all that I`ve blessed

Untouched sheets of clay

Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
E           A
All five horizons revolved

Around her soul, as the earth to the sun
E              A                  E

E          A
 I take a walk outside

I`m surrounded by some kids at play
E                 A          E
I can feel their laughter,  so why do I sear?

Pre-Refrão:
 C                                        Em
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head, I`m spinning

We`re one in the river
And one again after the fall

Always wanna go
But you never wanna stay

Always wanna play
But you never wanna lose

When you lose small mind
You free your life

I don`t mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can`t feed on the powerless
When my cup`s already overfilled

The fire is cooking
And they`re farming babies
While slaves are working
Blood is on the table
And the mouths are choking
But I`m growing hungry

In a         room full of emptiness
        Gm   F
By a freeway I confess
      Dm7(11)              Eb
I was         lost in the pages

Gm         F
Of a book full of death
 Dm7(11)           Eb
Reading how we`ll die alone

And if we`re good we`ll lay to rest

I was there so long ago
      Gm                  F

Letra:

 Outshined
(Chris Cornell)

Intro 4x
I got up feeling so down
I got off being sold out
I`ve kept the movie rolling
But the story`s getting old now

Oh yeah

I just looked in the mirror
Things aren`t looking so good
I`m looking California
And feeling Minnesota

Oh yeah

So now you know, 
who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I`d like to say
That I`m down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I`m up on my feet again
I`m feeling outshined
 
SOLO 4x  
 

Someone let the dogs out
They`ll show you where the truth is
The grass is always greener
Where the dogs are shedding

Yeah oh yeah

I`m feeling that I`m sober
Even though I`m drinking
I can`t get any lower
Still I feel I`m sinking

So now you know, who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I`d like to say
That I`m down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I`m up on my feet again
I`m feeling outshined


Guitarra

Refrao 
So now you know, who gets mystified

2x
Show me the power child, I`d like to say
That I`m down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I`m up on my feet again

I`m feeling   I`m feeling   outshined")
